API INTEGRATION (PYTHON)


*WHAT WE NEED*

1. API Key

2. url

3. Libraries needed - 
             1. import json
             2. import requests
             3. in command prompt download - pip install requests 
                                             (to handle requests)


*HOW WE DO*

4. Find API
   e.g. To fetch temperature of a city

5. Create a variable
   e.g. city_name = input("Enter a city name to know the temperature : ")

6. Now to make an API call, we will need an API key.
   Create a variable
   api_key = '' (paste the API key inside '') (Also not to share API keys to others)

7. Paste the url inside '' of the variable
   api_url = ''
   convert into f string to accept the url because that url is a string and f-string will convert it to       
   value
   api_url = f''

8. Now the url should look like this (by modifying some {} and{})
   e.g. api_url = f'           {city_name}     {api_key}'
   now if we copy paste this link/url in the browser we will get a lot of the data
   for e.g. about weather, rain, temperature, location, etc

9. Now we will use request library which we imported
   create a variable
   get_server_information = request.get(api_url)

10. Now to run this data in python (e.g. to get the city weather data)
    print(get_server_information.json())
        we will now run the python program - 
        Enter a city name to know the temperature : Goa
        (Here we will get the weather data as output, this is the same information we got on the browser)

11. Now, lets save the data in variable so that it can be used wherever we want
    data = (get_server_information.json())
    print(data)

12. To get the outout data readable (in string format)
    pretty_data = json.dumps(data, indent=4)
    print(pretty_data)
    Now the output is more readable
