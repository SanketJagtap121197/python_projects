TYPES OF GRAPHS IN DSA PYTHON

1. Directed and Undirected Graphs
Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction (e.g., A â†’ B).
Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction (e.g., A - B).

2. Weighted and Unweighted Graphs
Weighted Graph: Edges have weights or costs.
Unweighted Graph: All edges have the same weight or no weight.

3. Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs
Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle.
Acyclic Graph: Has no cycles (e.g., Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG).

4. Connected and Disconnected Graphs
Connected Graph: Every node is reachable from any other node.
Disconnected Graph: Some nodes are not connected.

5. Bipartite Graph
A graph whose nodes can be divided into two sets, with edges only between sets.

6. Complete Graph
A graph where every pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

7. Sparse and Dense Graphs
Sparse Graph: Few edges relative to nodes.
Dense Graph: Many edges relative to nodes.
